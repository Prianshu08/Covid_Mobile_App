# Description

This is a development archive of a high fidelity prototype or a UI design of a covid-19 immunization app. The prototype was developed over many iterative cycles and brainstorming for possible sketches, storyboards, paper prototyping and prototype walkthroughs. The milestone folders each consist of a three week development period in the early stage, middle stage and final stage of the prototype. Every stage involved brainstorming, suggesting new solutions for design improvement and making changes based on the decided solutions.
